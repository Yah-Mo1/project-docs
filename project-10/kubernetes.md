# Kubernetes Overview

## What is Kubernetes?

**Kubernetes** is a powerful platform designed to **orchestrate the deployment, scaling, and management** of container-based applications.

It is a **large open-source project** that automates various aspects of running containers across infrastructure.

## Core Functionality

The primary function of Kubernetes is **scheduling and managing applications** in containers across multiple nodes.

## Key Capabilities of Kubernetes

Kubernetes provides several essential features, including:

- **Load balancing** between nodes to distribute traffic efficiently.
- **Rolling updates** for seamless application deployment.
- **Mounting storage systems** to support persistent data.
- **Accessing application logs** for monitoring and debugging.
- **Distributing secrets** securely across applications.
- **Debugging applications** to identify and resolve issues.
- **Monitoring resources** to track performance and optimize usage.

## Primary Responsibility

The **main role of Kubernetes** is **container orchestration**, ensuring applications run efficiently and reliably across dynamic infrastructure.
